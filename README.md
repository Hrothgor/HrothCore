## Build

 - Just run the scripts in the `scripts` folder.
    - You might need to give the scripts permission to execute. (Linux or MacOS) (chmod +x)
    - The scripts will create a `build` folder, build the engine, link it to the project Sandbox and make an executable.
    - You can find the Sandbox executable in the `bin` folder (if not find it in `build`).
